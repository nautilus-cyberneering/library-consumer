Lord Henry looked at him.  Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair.  There was something in his face that made one trust him at once.  All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth's passionate purity.  One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world.  No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.

"You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray--far too charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.

The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready.  He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry's last remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?"

Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray.  "Am I to go, Mr. Gray?" he asked.

"Oh, please don't, Lord Henry.  I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods, and I can't bear him when he sulks.  Besides, I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy."

"I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.  It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it.  But I certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.  You don't really mind, Basil, do you?  You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to."

Hallward bit his lip.  "If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay. Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself."

Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves.  "You are very pressing, Basil, but I am afraid I must go.  I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans.  Good-bye, Mr. Gray.  Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street.  I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when you are coming.  I should be sorry to miss you."

"Basil," cried Dorian Gray, "if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go, too.  You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.  Ask him to stay.  I insist upon it."

"Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me," said Hallward, gazing intently at his picture.  "It is quite true, I never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters.  I beg you to stay."

"But what about my man at the Orleans?"

The painter laughed.  "I don't think there will be any difficulty about that.  Sit down again, Harry.  And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says.  He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single exception of myself."

Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek martyr, and made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather taken a fancy.  He was so unlike Basil.  They made a delightful contrast.  And he had such a beautiful voice.  After a few moments he said to him, "Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry?  As bad as Basil says?"

"There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.  All influence is immoral--immoral from the scientific point of view."

"Why?"

"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul.  He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions.  His virtues are not real to him.  His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed.  He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.  The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly--that is what each of us is here for.  People are afraid of themselves, nowadays.  They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self.  Of course, they are charitable.  They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar.  But their own souls starve, and are naked.  Courage has gone out of our race.  Perhaps we never really had it.  The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion--these are the two things that govern us.  And yet--"

"Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy," said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before.

"And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, "I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream--I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.  But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself.  The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives.  We are punished for our refusals.  Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.  The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.  Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.  The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.  Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.  It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain.  It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.  You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame--"

"Stop!" faltered Dorian Gray, "stop! you bewilder me.  I don't know what to say.  There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.  Don't speak.  Let me think.  Or, rather, let me try not to think."
