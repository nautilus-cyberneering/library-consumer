"A tame suspense I was not born to endure, and I determined           to clear         my doubts at all hazards and events.

"I answered it, therefore, in Orville's name.

"The views which I am now going to acknowledge, must,           infallibly,         incur your displeasure;-yet I scorn all palliation.

"Briefly, then, I concealed your  prevent a           discovery of         your capacity; and I wrote you an answer, which I hoped would         prevent your wishing for any other.

"I am well aware of every thing which can be said upon           this subject.         Lord Orville will, possibly, think himself ill-used; but I am         extremely indifferent as to his opinion; nor do I now write         by way of offering any apology to him, but merely to make         known to yourself the reasons by which I have been governed.

"I intend to set off next week for the Continent. Should his         Lordship have any commands for me in the mean time, I shall         be glad to receive them. I say not this by way of defiance,-I         should blush to be suspected of so doing through an indirect         channel; but simply that, if you show him this letter, he         may know I dare defend, as well as excuse, my conduct.           "CLEMENT WILLOUGHBY."  What a strange letter! how proud and how piqued does its writer  appear! To what alternate meanness and rashness do the passions lead, when reason and self-denial do not oppose them! Sir Clement is conscious he has acted dishonourably; yet the same unbridled vehemence, which urged him to gratify a blameable curiosity, will sooner prompt him to risk his life, than, confess his misconduct. The rudeness of his manner of writing to me, springs, from the same cause: the proof which he has received of my indifference to him, has stung him to the soul, and he has neither the delicacy nor forbearance to disguise his displeasure.

I determined not to show this  Lord Orville, and thought  it most prudent to let Sir Clement know I should not. I therefore wrote the following note:

"To Sir Clement Willoughby.

"SIR,

"The  have been pleased to address to me, is          so little         calculated to afford Lord Orville any satisfaction, that you         may depend upon my carefully keeping it from his sight. I will         bear you no resentment for what is past; but I most earnestly         intreat, nay implore, that you will not write again, while in         your present frame of mind, by any channel, direct or indirect.

"I hope you will have much pleasure in your promised          expedition; and         I beg leave to assure you of my good wishes." Not knowing by what name to sign, I was obliged to send it without any.

The preparations which Sir Clement mentions, go on just as if your consent were arrived: it is in vain that I expostulate; Lord Orville says, should any objections be raised, all shall be given up; but that, as his hopes forbid him to expect any, he must proceed as if already assured of your concurrence.

We have had, this afternoon, a most interesting conversation, in which we have traced our sentiments of each other from our first acquaintance. I have made him confess how ill he thought of me upon my foolish giddiness at Mrs.  Stanley's ball; but he flatters me with assurances, that every succeeding time he saw me, I appeared to something less and less disadvantage.

When I expressed my amazement that he could honour with his choice a girl who seemed so infinitely, in every respect, beneath his alliance, he frankly owned, that he had fully intended making more minute inquiries into my family and connections; particularly concerning those people he saw me with at Marybone, before he acknowledged his prepossession in my favour: but seeing me again, put him quite off his guard; and, "divesting him of prudence, left him nothing but love." These were his words; and yet, he has repeatedly assured me, that his partiality has known no bounds from the time of my residing at Clifton.  * * * * * *

Mr. Macartney has just been with me, on an embassy from my father. He has sent me his kindest love and assurances of favour; and desired to know if I am happy in the prospect of changing my situation, and if there is any thing I can name which he can do for me. And, at the same time, Mr. Macartney delivered to me a draught on my father's banker for a thousand pounds, which he insisted that I should receive entirely for my own use, and expend in equipping myself properly for the new rank of life to which I seem destined.

I am sure I need not say how much I was penetrated by this goodness: I wrote my thanks, and acknowledged, frankly, that if I could see him restored to tranquillity, my heart would be without a wish.

EVELINA IN CONTINUATION.  Clifton, Oct. 13th.

THE time approaches now when I hope we shall meet;-yet I cannot sleep;-great joy is a restless as sorrow,-and therefore I will continue my journal.

As I had never had an opportunity of seeing Bath, a party was formed last night for showing me that celebrated city; and this morning, after breakfast, we set out in three phaetons. Lady Louisa and Mrs. Beaumont with Lord Merton; Mr. Coverley, Mr. Lovel, and Mrs. Selwyn; and myself with Lord Orville.
